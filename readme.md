To run this application simply use:

```sh
docker compose up
```

When you have run this script, the site is available on: `http://localhost:8000` and the admin on: `http://localhost:8000/wp-admin`.

>  Note: It will either create a new docker container if it does not exist yet, otherwise re-use the existing one.

## Wordpress Theme

You can edit the theme `./bright-lives-theme`.

This folder is mounted to the docker WordPress volume so any change will be reflected automatically.

### CSS

**Do not edit this file directly**: `./bright-lives-theme/style.css`. This file is necessary in order for the theme to work. 

It will get overwritten by the file `./src/tailwind.css`. And since tailwind is used, you can directly use the tailwind
classes in the HTML. Then the CSS will be generated automatically if you run:

```bash
pnpm run style:watch
```

This will watch for changes and compiles new classes into `./bright-lives-theme/style.css` when you use them in HTML.

## Database mysqldump

If you would like to make a database dump use the following:

```sh
docker exec bright-lives-db-1 /usr/bin/mysqldump -u root --password=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD devdb > init-db.sql
```

This will update the `init-db.sql` file. This file is used when running the initial command to setup the Wordpress installation.
