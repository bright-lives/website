To run this application simply use:

```sh
docker compose up
```

When you have run this script, the site is available on: `http://localhost:8000` and the admin on: `http://localhost:8000/wp-admin`.

>  Note: It will either create a new docker container if it does not exist yet, otherwise re-use the existing one.

## Wordpress Theme

You can edit the theme `./bright-lives-theme`.

This folder is mounted to the docker WordPress volume so any change will be reflected automatically.

### CSS

**Do not edit this file directly**: `./bright-lives-theme/style.css`. This file is necessary in order for the theme to work.

Tailwind is used in this project.

When making changes to HTML run:

```bash
pnpm run style:watch
```

This will watch for changes and compiles the necessary classes into `./bright-lives-theme/tailwind.css`.

See `./tailwind.config.js` for the file paths that are being watched.

## Bright Lives Plugin

Hooks are located in the `bright-lives-hooks` plugin.

## Blocks (Gutenberg)

To be able to build pages with custom blocks are added next to the core blocks.

The source files of the blocks are located in `./src/blocks`.
The build folder is located in the plugin `./plugins/bright-lives-blocks/build`. Do not edit the files in this folder directly.

To edit these blocks run:

```bash
npm run start
```

When done with developing make sure to run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production ready build of the blocks.

## Database mysqldump

If you would like to make a database dump use the following:

```sh
docker exec bright-lives-db-1 /usr/bin/mysqldump -u root --password=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD devdb > init-db.sql
```

This will update the `init-db.sql` file. This file is used when running the initial command to setup the Wordpress installation.
